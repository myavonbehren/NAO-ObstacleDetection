## Introduction
During the Fall Quarter of my third year, I continued to work with Aldebaran Robotics’ NAO humanoid robot to develop a module dedicated to detecting obstacles and implementing avoidance strategies. Achieving this goal is instrumental to the enhancement of the robot’s functionality, as well as holding significant potential for diverse real-world applications.

I began my research by exploring the various sensors equipped on the NAO robot and identifying those I could utilize. I quickly realized that NAO’s ultrasonic sensors offered the most promising means of obstacle avoidance. According to Softbank Robotics documentation, the NAO robot has two ultrasonic sensors that can identify obstacles within a specified range of 0.25m to 0.80m in its environment.

In addition to the ultrasonic sensors, I considered the tactile sensors a potential solution, especially in situations where the ultrasonic sensors might be limited by distance. Lastly, I considered incorporating NAO’s camera into the project to enhance capabilities such as detecting specific objects.
